# ERA5_LPM_reader
This is a reader code for the meteorological forcing generated for HiMAT2.
The precipitation field was generated using the localized probability matching mean (LPM) using three gridded precipitation products (GPM IMERG, CHIRPS, and ERA5).
The other meteorological forcings were generated by downscaling ERA5 to 5km.
